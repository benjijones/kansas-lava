-- | This module implements an Ack protocol. In this producer/consumer model,
-- the producer drives the data input of the consumer, using an enable to
-- indicate that data is present. The producer will then keep the data value
-- steady until it receives an Ack from the consumer, at which point it's free
-- to drive the data input with a different value. This assumes that consumer
-- latches the input, as it may change.
